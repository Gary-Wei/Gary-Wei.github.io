Hello! My name is Jiarui (Gary) Wei, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Management at the University of Texas at Dallas. 

[//]: # (I will be on the 2025â€“2026 academic job market. My research leverages Generative AI and game-theoretic models to enhance managerial decision-making. I pursue two main research streams. The first focuses on probabilistic goods. In this stream, my job market paper examines consumer dynamic responses to the limited-time product sequences, while my Marketing Science paper investigates optimal pricing and probability allocations.)

[//]: # (The second stream focuses on behavioral industrial organization, particularly in service marketing. One working paper designs dynamic contracts for service providers when consumers are influenced by availability bias. Another paper optimizes the rollover policy for unused subcription quota when forgetful customers are served.)

I received my B.Eng. (Systems Engineering and Engineering Management) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
