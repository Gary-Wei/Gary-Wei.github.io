Hello! Welcome to my page! 

[//]: # (I will be on the 2025â€“2026 academic job market. My research leverages Generative AI and game-theoretic models to enhance managerial decision-making. I pursue two main research streams. The first focuses on probabilistic goods. In this stream, my job market paper examines consumer dynamic responses to the limited-time product sequences, while my Marketing Science paper investigates optimal pricing and probability allocations.)

<h2 id="about me" style="margin-top: 2rem;">About Me</h2>
My name is Jiarui (Gary) Wei, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Management at the The University of Texas at Dallas. 

My research addresses the critical sustainability challenges that arise from technology-driven operations, specifically focusing on the massive energy demands of data centers spurred by the growth of AI, and the complex fulfillment trade-offs on e-commerce platforms. I use optimization modeling and large-scale empirical data to develop practical solutions that help manage the operational efficiency and environmental impacts of these AI-powered systems, offering guidance for stakeholders ranging from microgrid operators to platform sellers.

Prior to UTD, I worked as a junior research assistant at The Chinese University of Hong Kong Business School, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. <p><a href="https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/gong-xiting">Xiting Gong</a></p>. I obtained my B.Eng. in Systems Engineering and Engineering Management at CUHK as well.

[//]: # (The second stream focuses on behavioral industrial organization, particularly in service marketing. One working paper designs dynamic contracts for service providers when consumers are influenced by availability bias. Another paper optimizes the rollover policy for unused subscription quota when forgetful customers are served.)
